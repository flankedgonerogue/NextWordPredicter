### About
- C++ terminal application that attempts to guess your next word based on how frequent a certain word is entered. It displays the top four words, starting with the most frequent on the left side.
- [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) is the terminal UI library used
- **It is not context-aware** It only assumes the next word based on it's occurrence frequency.
- The ADT used to create links between words is a graph.

## Key binds
- `F1` for the first predicted word insertion
- `F2` for the second predicted word insertion
- `F3` for the third predicted word insertion
- `F4` for the four predicted word insertion
- `q` to quit the application
